# CS 131 Spring 2023: Project Starter

Hey there! This is a template repository that contains the necessary boilerplate for [CS 131](https://ucla-cs-131.github.io/spring-23/)'s quarter-long project: making an interpreter. The project specs are as follows:

1. [Project 1 Spec](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pPQ2qZKbbsbZGBSwvuy1Ir-NZLPMgVt95WPQuI5aPho)
1. [Project 2 Spec](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1simlDMO0TK-YNDPYjkuU1C3fcaBpbIVYRaKD1pdqJj8/edit?usp=sharing)

There are three stages to the project; students are currently at the second. Thus, this folder contains the necessary bootstrapping code:

- `intbase.py`, the base class and enum definitions for the interpreter
- `bparser.py`, a static `parser` class to parse Brewin programs
- `interpreterv1.py`, a working top-level interpreter for project 1 that mostly delegates interpreting work to:
  - `classv1.py` which handles class, field, and method definitions
  - `env1.py` which handles the program environment (a map from variables to values)
  - `objectv1.py` which handles operations on *objects*, which include statements, expressions, etc; most of the code is here!
  - `type_valuev1.py` which has classes to create type tags

You can view the starter for [Project 1](https://github.com/UCLA-CS-131/spring-23-project-starter/releases/tag/p1).

Some notes on your submission (for Project 2)

1. You **must have a top-level, versioned `interpreterv2.py` file** that **exports the `Interpreter` class**. If not, **your code will not run on our autograder**.
2. You may also submit one or more additional `.py` modules that your interpreter uses, if you decide to break up your solution into multiple `.py` files.
3. You **should not modify/submit `intbase.py` or `bparser.py`**; we will use our own when grading.

You can find out more about our autograder, including how to run it, in [its accompanying repo](https://github.com/UCLA-CS-131/spring-23-autograder).
