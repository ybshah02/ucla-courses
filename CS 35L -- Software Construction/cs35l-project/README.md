Devs: Neil Kardan, Tyler Stovsky, Chelsea Biala, Luke Dalton, Yash Shah

To run this application, one must first run the script 'npm run update' in the project root folder. That should install the dependencies required to run the application, and then you can run the script 'npm run dev' to start the client and server. If the script doesn't already open up a page on localhost:3000 with the website, then go to your chosen browser (preferably chrome) and type in localhost:3000 to go to the site.
