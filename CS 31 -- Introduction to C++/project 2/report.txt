a.

I would say that there was two notable challenges to overcome in writing the code for this project. 

The first challenge was in the first if statement when checking that the months were inputted in the right format -- instead of the && after each month.compare statement originally, I used || instead because I was directly translating English to code, which caused my code to continuously give me an output of "invalid month" even when I knew that the input was correct. 

The second challenge revolved around the leap year offset in which I was a tad bit confused on how I would structure the if statement to not include years that were evenly divisible by 100, with the exception of being evenly divisible by 400. I tinkered around for a few minutes, trying different things and then I eventually got to the statement that I had now, but it took some time to make sure that years like 1800 and 1900 weren't considered leap years.

Month is a string of numbers rather than letters ("-101", -101, -101)

Capitalization of first letter of month ("january", 30, 2000) 

Capitalization only applies to first letter not full string ("SEPTEMBER", 30, 2000) 

Random capitalization of letters in month input ("DEcEmBeR", 30, 2000)

Extra space before correct format of month matters (" March", 30, 2000)

Extra space after correct format of month matters ("October ", 30, 2000)

Extra word after first correctly formatted month ("January january", 30, 2000)

Negative day ("June", -5, 2000)

Day greater than 31 ("June", 39, 2000)

Negative year ("June", 20, -2000)

Year greater than 3000 ("June", 20, 3100)

Leap year that is divisible by 4, 100, and 400 ("August", 15, 2000)

Leap year that is divisible by only 4 ("February", 15, 2020)

Non Leap year that is divisible by 4 and 100, but not 400 ("January", 15, 1800)

Non Leap year ("August", 15, "2002")

Submission day is Saturday ("January", 23, 2021)

Correct day on leap year ("February", 14, 1996) 

Correct day on non-leap year that is divisible by 4 and 100, but not 400 ("July", 10, 2100)
