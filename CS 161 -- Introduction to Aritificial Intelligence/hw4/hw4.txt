1. Use RSat to solve the SAT instance obtained above. Is the instance satisfiable?

No

2. Do the conversion again, this time, with 4 colors. Use RSat to solve this new SAT instance. Is the
instance satisfiable?

Yes

3. What do the answers of these two SAT instances tell you about the graph coloring problem of the
above graph? Can you give a solution (a coloring) to the graph coloring problem of the above graph
based on the results of RSat?

highest degree of the nodes in the above graph is 4

solution:

node    color
----    -----
1       green
2       red  
3       green
4       yellow
5       blue
6       red
7       yellow

4. Now, use a similar approach to solve the graph coloring of the graph described in graph2.txt. What is
the minimum number of colors required to properly color this graph?

min # of colors = 8
